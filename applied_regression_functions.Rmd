## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(sf)

library(broom)
library(lubridate)
```


#grocery and pharma regressions

```{r}

gp_by_state <- by_state_cases(cmvv_avg100k$grocery_pharma_pctchange)

gp_all_risk <- all_state_risk(cmvv_avg100k$grocery_pharma_pctchange)
gp_all_risk <- all_state_risk(cmvv_avg100k$grocery_pharma_pctchange)
